## Changes from initial plan

---

<p>While we initially wanted to use our backend with MySQL, we found that Firebase suited our backend better as it allowed for user authentication and also data storage </p>
We also decided to add a telegram bot to value add to our product. The FAQ were generated from feedback during our initial round of UAT
