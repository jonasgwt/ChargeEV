# Git Workflow

---
As we split the work by features, most of the time, we will be working on different components simultaneously. This is done by making use of branches in Github.

For instance, person A is working on Host features for the app, while person B is working on the ChargeMap features. We will create two separate branches, and persons A and B will work on their respective branches.

After we are done with creating our assigned feature, we will then merge with the master branch. Should there be any conflicts, we will review the conflicted code together.
