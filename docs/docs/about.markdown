<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

### Aim

ChargeEV is a mobile-based application targeted towards EV users in large countries to
provide them with additional locations to charge their vehicles if superchargers are not
available in the current area.

### Motivation

Many countries have been shifting their focus to electric vehicles (EV) in recent years.
However, in many larger countries such as the United States (US) and Australia, electric
cars are seen as less superior compared to traditional petrol vehicles in terms of range
and convenience.
Due to its short range, many people are put off purchasing EVs as they cannot
travel out of large cities where superchargers are usually located. ChargEV aims to
solve this problem by enabling people to loan out chargers so that EV users can charge
anywhere, even in the most remote areas.
While apps on the market show EV chargers locations, it does not enable users to add
their chargers and rent them out. With outdoor chargers costing up to $15000, some
users might be unwilling to install them. Additionally, in rural areas, there might be a lack
of charging stations, and thus users will be able to share.

### Key Features

* ChargEV will consist of two sections, GetACharge and GiveACharge.
* GetACharge will consist of users looking to charge their EVs. Using their current
location, the app will find suitable chargers for the user, and they can then select
the preferred charge point depending on distance etc.
* GiveACharge will consist of hosts that provide users with charging points. Hosts
offer details such as an address, photos, charger type, available times,
instructions etc. Hosts can also have the option to charge users a chosen
amount. The app will provide a recommended cost for the host based on their
need to charge. Users will tentatively make payments through a QR code.

### Target Audience

* ChargEV will be targeting countries or areas that are more sparse where it is more difficult to locate
a charger
* Such areas include the rural areas in the United States
* We do not believe the host feature will be used significantly in Singapore due to the density of EV chargers present
