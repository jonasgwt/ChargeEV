# Roadmap

---

### Planning

* For our planning, we employed Agile. We broke our App features into smaller deliverables. Within the 3 months period, we worked on each feature by:
* Planning -> Design -> Code -> Test -> Reflect
* This allowed for us to work fast and build our product feature by feature. With Agile, we do not need to spend excessive amount of time to debug and test.
* Our roadmap was adjusted when we realised we were unable to meet deadlines
* We used product management tools such as instagantt to distribute work and better picture our roadmap
