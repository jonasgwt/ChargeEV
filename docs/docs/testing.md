# Testing

---

* We have carried out unit tests. All documentation can be found on google sheets.
* To conduct unit tests, we have identified our key features. We then broke down it into specific steps and tested them
* We tested core features internally and after that, we requested the help of peers to do testing and provide feedback to us on the product so far.
* We have also collected textual feedback via Google Forms and a visualisation of the positive and negative feedback can be seen on our poster.
* The feedback was collected during the acceptance testing stage of our app
* We have documented bugs that we have resolved. This helps us to understand if previously solved bugs were not squashed successfully
* Should similar bugs keep happening, there could be underlying problems that require more than a simple fix

### Conclusions from Testing

* For internal and unit tests, the issues that arose are mainly technical in nature, where features fail because they do not behave as intended.

* For the external test, issues that were raised were regarding user experience. For instance, the lack of a back button etc. Some other issues include "good to have features" that were overlooked by us during our planning.
