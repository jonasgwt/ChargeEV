* We tested core features internally and after that we requested the help of peers to do testing and provide feedback to us of the product so far.
The results are shown in the following sheet
* We have also collected textual feedback via Google Forms and are in the mindst of cleaning up the data. A visualisation of the positive and negative feedback can be seen on our MS2 poster.
