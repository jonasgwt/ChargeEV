# Competitors

---

### Current competition

* We have not identified an app that implements the same ideas as ours.

* There are apps that allow the locating of chargers in general, we are aware of such apps. We have allowed for the non-ChargeEV chargers to be shown as well as this will attract more users to the app

### Plans

* One drawback is that our app requires sign-ups which could hold back potential users

* A way is to create a mode which allows for non-signed up users to use the app, however CRM methods will have to be thought off to encourage them to sign up

* We have an advantage without many competitors, this also means the market share is likely to be small. There will have to be a greater drive to increase the potential market.
