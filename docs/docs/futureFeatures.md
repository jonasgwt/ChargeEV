# Future Features

---
Due to our limited time, we cannot develop several features that will further improve the app.

* View Booking History Feature
* Android Compatibility
* Chat Feature

There are also several features that we want to develop but are unable to due to the lack of a reliable API.

* Charging users by kwh <br> There are APIs that allow us to track how much by kwh a user used at the charging station. However, not every EV company has an API, and there isn't one API that can be used for all EVs. For now, only Tesla has an API that allows such tracking as seen <a href="https://www.teslaapi.io/">here</a>

* Providing charger type and price information for public chargers <br>
We could not find a reliable API that provides such comprehensive information for public chargers worldwide.
